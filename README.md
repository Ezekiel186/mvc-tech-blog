# mvc-tech-blog

## Description
This project was my first project on MVCs, clearly you can see I struggled. I could not finish on time. The code for creating a new post, logging in, and commenting is there. I did not give myself enough time to figure the issues out. There were also not enough examples in our classwork for me to reference.
